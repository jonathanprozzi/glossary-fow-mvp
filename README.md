# Interactive Glossary

This is an interactive glossary tool created to support the [Digital Harbor Foundation](https://www.digitalharbor.org/) in the _Future of Work_ program in Summer 2020.

## Inspiration

- There are many vocabulary terms in the curriculum, so we wanted to make a fun, interactive way for new learners to practice
- For an open access version to many of the *Future of Work* resources, check out our [Learning Library Future of Work Playlist](https://library.digitalharbor.org/playlists/future-of-work) at https://library.digitalharbor.org/playlists/future-of-work

## Made With

- [Next.js (React)](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
